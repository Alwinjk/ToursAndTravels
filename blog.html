                        Why do people travel? They travel because it teaches you about yourselves, about the world,
                        learning new things, be independent, many moments which you will remember a lifetime, expanding
                        your perspective, and many more. But when planning a trip, people think of traveling abroad than
                        the home country. I am sure during this period when people are locked in their houses, they
                        would be checking websites for India tour packages to travel to nearby places. Just think how
                        much have you explored India? With the government slowly opening up the restrictions on travel
                        and hotels, it is the best time to visit India.

                        Travel is a wonderful feeling and we travel for various reasons. It could be 5-6 days trip to
                        explore & learn about new places or weekend getaways just to relax in a different place where we
                        have not been to. Mostly, we want to get away from our daily routine life or in a way you can
                        say escaping from our daily work, stress & responsibilities.

                        Below are 3 reasons you must look for you to visit within India:
                    </div>
                    <h3>1. Backwaters & beaches:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kerala is famous for its backwaters and a stay in a houseboat is very special. In India, there
                        are many famous beaches where people from all over India & abroad visit. It is the best time to
                        visit the beaches & have a relaxed time. You can also visit some of the other beaches where you
                        have not been to like Marina Beach in Chennai, Ganpatiphule & Tarkarli beach in Maharashtra,
                        Dhanushkodi beach in Rameshwaram, Serenity beach in Pondicherry and many more.

                    <h3>2. Visit the Himalayas:</h3>
                    <p>
                        India is known for its Himalayan ranges from Jammu Kashmir to West Bengal. There are various
                        things you can do on a Himalayan trip like trekking, adventure, visit temples, or just relax and

                        culture. Their dressing style is different from the plain areas and worth taking a photo in

                    <h3> 3. Stay in palaces & feel like Nawab:</h3>

                        you, the way they talk, and serve you. Many people opt for this as a city break. Some of them
                        have museums also where they have kept the utensils used, music systems during Maharaja times,
                        old photos, etc which gives you an idea of how the Maharaja’s used to stay.
